# When to use class methods and when to use static methods
    We use static methods when what we want to do does not have to be
    unique for the instance.
    We use class methods to do something that has a relationship
    with the lass, but usually, those are used to manipulate different
    structures of data to instantiate objects, like we have done with CSV.
